# Python-Lectures  

This Python-Lectures is part of [SCOUT](www.scoutlive.in) - Python Programming DS 101 course curriculum


## Introduction

Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming.

We will be using [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) throughout this course for Course materials and course assignment submission. 


## Installation


Mac OS X and Linux comes pre installed with python. Windows users can download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ .

To install Jupyter run,

    $ pip install jupyter[all]
    
This will install all the necessary dependencies for the notebook, qtconsole, tests etc.



### Installation from Anaconda

Installing all the necessary libraries might prove troublesome for some.

We recommend using Anaconda which comes pre packaged with all the necessary python libraries and also Jupyter Notebook.


#### Anaconda

Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

Anaconda is completely free and includes more than 300 python packages. Both python 2.7 and 3.4 options are available.



## Launching Jupyter Notebook

From the terminal

    jupyter notebook

In Anaconda, Open the respective terminals and execute the above or Launch the Jupyter notebook from Anaconda Home page.


## How to learn from this resource?


It is better to download all the Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb files) from this repository https://github.com/suvajit/Python-Lectures and learn it on the local editable copy of the notebooks.

Refer to this [Jupyter Tutorial](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) to get started on how to use your Juoyter notebook for writing your Python program exercises.
